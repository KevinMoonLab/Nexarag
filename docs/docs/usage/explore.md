# Exploring Knowledge Graphs
There are three ways to explore Nexarag knowledge graphs: 
* Built-in LLM chat feature
* Interactive visualization tools
* Filtering

## Interactive Chat Feature
The Nexarag chat feature, available in the right sidebar, uses context from paper abstracts, documents, authors, and other data and relationships in the knowledge graph to respond to user queries. 

1. Click the chat menu item in the right sidebar. 
2. **[Optional]** Click the cog on the right sidebar and choose a different Ollama model or specify a different system prompt.
3. Ask a question about the knowledge graph!
